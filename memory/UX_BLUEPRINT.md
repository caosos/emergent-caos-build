# CAOS — UX Blueprint (locked contract)
_Built from 20+ screenshots of user's deployed Base44 (`caos-chat-9c5683d8.base44.app`) and Emergent-hosted (`deno-env-review.emergent.host`) versions. This is the single source of truth. Agent must NOT deviate without explicit user approval._

---

## A0. Pre-login Welcome screen (first surface unauth'd users see)
Full-screen dark starfield. Centered column:
- Big purple orb avatar (sparkle icon inside a gradient circle)
- `CAOS` (massive H1, white)
- `Cognitive Adaptive Operating System` (blue subtitle)
- Tagline: `A personal AI platform that thinks, remembers, and works alongside you — not just answers questions.`
- **Feature grid (2×2 cards, subtle glass panels):**
  - 🧠 **Persistent Memory** — Aria remembers what matters across every session.
  - 🔍 **Web Search** — Real-time knowledge from the internet, built in.
  - 📄 **File Intelligence** — Upload files, images, docs — Aria reads them all.
  - 🎤 **Voice Ready** — Speak to Aria or have her read responses aloud.
- **[✨ Take the Tour]** primary purple gradient button
- **[→] Sign In]** secondary bordered button
- `Continue as Guest` text link below
- Footer attribution (tiny): `CAOS · AI assistant platform · Aria AI persona · Memory system · Multi-provider inference (OpenAI, Gemini) · Web search · File intelligence · Voice I/O · Base44 platform`

## A. Auth / Sign-In screen (`/login`)
Clean white card, centered, light background. Contains:

- `Sign in to continue`
- **[ G Continue with Google ]** primary button
- `— OR —` divider
- Email field (`you@example.com`)

## B. Welcome Tour (5 steps, shown first-run)
Modal card, dark glass, dot progress indicator at top (5 dots, active one brighter).
Each step: title + body + `[Skip tour]` left · `[Next →]` (or `[Get started →]` on final) right.

1. **Start here** — "Type anything — a question, a task, code, a plan. Aria reads it and responds with real intelligence, not canned replies."
2. **Your threads** — "Every conversation is saved automatically. Switch between threads, search your history, and pick up exactly where you left off."
3. **Aria remembers** — "Tell Aria to remember something and she will — across every future session. Your preferences, your projects, your context."
4. **Attach anything** — "Drop in files, images, screenshots, or take a photo. Aria can see, read, and reason about everything you share. You can paste the image from the clipboard."
5. **Get started** — final CTA button `Get started →`

## C. Shell — top bar (3 columns)
| LEFT | CENTER | RIGHT |
|---|---|---|
| `[sidebar-toggle icon]` `M MICHAEL ▼` | `CAOS` + `Cognitive Adaptive Operating System` | active-thread-name · `[🔍 search-this-thread]` · `X.XK / 200.0K` meter |

- The `M MICHAEL ▼` chip IS the menu trigger — no separate hamburger.
- Dropdown: `Desktop ›` · `+ New Thread` · `Previous Threads` · `Profile` · `Engine = ⚡OpenAI/Claude/Gemini` (inline toggle) · `Log Out`

## D. Left rail (contained, scrollable, default CLOSED)
- `Search chats…` input at top
- Menu: **Chat** (active) · Create · Tools · Models · Projects · Threads
- `RECENT` header → recent thread cards

### Thread cards (inside Previous Threads drawer)
Each card:
- Title (bold, ellipsized)
- Preview snippet (2 lines)
- `X ago` timestamp
- Mini-WCW progress meter: `19.3K / 200.0K` with bar
- Inline actions (always visible or hover-reveal): 
  - 🔵 pencil → rename
  - 🟡 flag → mark for follow-up
  - 🔴 trash → delete
- Active thread: purple glow/outline

## E. Center surface — welcome state

## F. Engine pills (above composer, centered)
- `⚡ Claude click to switch` (yellow outline glow when active)
- `Multi-Agent OFF` toggle pill
- Tooltip on hover: `Engine: Claude — click to switch`

## G. Composer (floating ~1in off bottom, glass shell)
Horizontal row:
1. 📎 attach (upload files)
2. 🔊 speaker (auto-read responses toggle)
3. `+` thought stash button
4. textarea: `Ask anything… and switch models mid chat with no problem!` (auto-grow 1–6 rows)
5. 🎤 mic (pulsing red ring + live transcript ribbon when recording)
6. ▶ purple-gradient circular send

Below composer: suggestion chips from user's projects (`Project Alpha`, `Immigration plan`, `CAOS build`).

Footer chip: `💾 Memory: N facts saved` (green pill).

**Mic behavior:** STT APPENDS at cursor position (with a space), does NOT overwrite.

## H. Message bubbles
- **User**: right-aligned, purple-gradient background, rounded with asymmetric bottom-right corner, purple glow shadow. Action chips below: `📋 Copy` · `↩ Reply` · `👍 Useful`
- **CAOS (assistant)**: left-aligned, subtle dark glass card, small purple orb avatar on left. Same 3 action chips + Read Aloud.
- Message footer: `Apr 20, 2026 • 1:00 AM • 28.5s` + `> Evidence` expandable
- Long outputs show `Show full output…` link

## I. Profile drawer (right side)
Header: `Profile` + X close.

- Section: **Runtime** — `openai · gpt-5.2` (or current provider.model)
- Section: **Used for recall** — `No turn yet` or hydration summary
- Section: **Subject bins** — `No bins selected` or pills

## L. Search — TWO separate surfaces
1. **Search all threads** (from left-rail `Search chats…`) — fuzzy across all threads, returns thread cards
2. **Search THIS thread** — TWO entry points:
   - Left-side `Search Thread` panel: query echo, `Search this thread` input, numbered results (`#1 You 1:56` + snippet)
   - Top-right inline `fre…` search: filters messages in the active thread with yellow `<mark>` highlights + match count `7` + X to clear → opens right-side results panel

## M. Selection reaction popover
Highlight any text in a message → popover appears:
- 31 emoji reactions (frequency-sorted, most-used first)
- Text reply input
- `🔊 Read` (browser speechSynthesis)
- `📋 Copy`
- `✉ Email` (Resend integration — Phase 7a)
- Auto-dismiss after 4s inactivity

## N. Bottom behavioral rules
- **Click-outside-to-close** is MANDATORY on every drawer, popover, modal, menu.
- **Escape key** closes the same.
- **Auto-dismiss status banners** after 4s (no sticky "Read Aloud unavailable" messages).
- **Optimistic user message** — appears instantly on send.
- **Typing dots** while awaiting first stream delta.
- **Streaming cursor (▌)** during SSE delta render.
- **Rename thread**: inline editable title on click-pencil.
- **Flag thread**: toggle state, shown as orange tag on card.
- **Delete thread**: confirmation modal before destructive action.

## O. Complaint auto-flag to Admin (Phase 4 feature)
- Chat pipeline runs a sentiment/complaint classifier on each user message.
- If classified as a complaint, Aria responds with: `"Want me to escalate this to admin?"` with Yes/No inline buttons.
- On Yes, backend sends a Resend email to admin with the thread excerpt.
- No more "go email feedback" — chat handles it.

## P. File handling
- Upload multi-file (max 10 currently — platform-capped).
- Zip support: unzip server-side, index contents (when platform allows).
- Images → auto-attach to `UserMessage.file_contents` for Gemini provider.
- Non-Gemini providers get filename + mime + size in system prompt.

## Q. Auth + role
- Emergent-managed Google OAuth.
- User `mytaxicloud@gmail.com` → auto-assigned **Admin** role on first login (seeded).
- Admin role unlocks: Game Mode, Developer Mode, Multi-Agent Mode, System Console.

## Build order (locked sequence)
1. Fix STT append-at-cursor (Composer bug)
2. Threads-in-sidebar (contained, not overlay) + inline card actions + mini-WCW meters
3. Left rail menu (Chat/Create/Tools/Models/Projects/Threads) + RECENT section
4. Welcome hero + 3-card carousel
5. Profile drawer 6-toggle parity + Admin role auto-assign for user's email
6. 5-step Welcome Tour modal (shown on first login only)
7. Click-outside-to-close audit across every drawer/popover
8. Mic recording indicator (pulsing + live transcript + timer)
9. Login screen visual parity (Google button + Email/Password fallback)
10. Selection popover → Email button (Resend integration, Phase 7a)
11. Complaint auto-flag pipeline (Phase 4)

Each step ships independently. No big-bang rebuild.
